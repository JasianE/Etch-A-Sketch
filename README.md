# Etch-A-Sketch
A project created for the TOP curriculum. 

Ok so a pretty decent time ago this was practically the bane of my existence, I mean I thought about it and it made me feel bad, I procrastinated which made me feel bad
and whenever I reflected on what I've done with TOP I just shrunk cause I didn't make this project. Fast forward to, well, now, and uh... this is such an easy project
!!! Maybe I became a way better programmer (not), maybe I've become more patient, or maybe I've just become a more confident person. Who knows????? Not me.... 
Anyway, have fun with this project! :)
